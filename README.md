## Steps for use:
1. Install this userscript.
2. Open a YouTube video.
3. Enjoy an AD free YouTube video!

## Key Points:
1. This skips all types of ads & It skips instantly!! 😲
2. This removes ads that come on the side and removes the incoming ad alert. 🙌
3. This skips unskippable ads by speeding up the video to a maximum playback rate of 16, (default 1) 💨
4. This script works on all browsers and has been thoroughly tested 📝
5. At the moment, this will take away custom playback functionality. In the next update, this will most likely be fixed. ⚠
6. If you have any issues or recommendations please contact me.
